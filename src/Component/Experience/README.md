# Dynamic Import
The import() function in JavaScript is a function-like expression that returns a promise. This feature is commonly referred to as "dynamic import" because it allows you to load modules or files dynamically at runtime rather than statically at the beginning of the module.

### Promises and .then()
When you use import(), it returns a promise. A promise represents an operation that hasn't completed yet but is expected in the future. Once the promise resolves (i.e., the import operation is successful), the .then() method is called with the resolved value.

### Handling the Imported Module
In this case, when you use import('./experienceData.json'), the promise resolves to an object that contains the contents of the imported JSON file.

However, this object is a module object, which has a default property containing the actual content of the JSON file. This happens because the JSON file is treated as a module, and its default export is assigned to the default property.

The Line Explained
.then((data) => setExperienceData(data.default)):

data: This is the resolved value from the promise, representing the module object containing the JSON data.
data.default: Accesses the default export from the module, which is the actual content of the experienceData.json file.
setExperienceData(data.default): This calls the state update function setExperienceData with the actual data from the JSON file, thus updating the state experienceData.
Example Walkthrough
Here's what happens step-by-step when the component mounts:

Import Attempt: The import('./experienceData.json') statement attempts to dynamically import the JSON file.

Promise Resolves: Once the import is successful, the promise resolves with an object (data) representing the imported module.

Access Default Export: The actual JSON data is accessed via data.default.

Update State: The setExperienceData function is called with the JSON data, updating the component's state. This update triggers a re-render of the component with the new data.

### Why .default?
In ES6 modules, when you use the export default syntax, whatever you export becomes the default property of the import result. In the case of JSON files and dynamic imports, the content of the JSON file is treated as the default export of the module.

If you were importing the JSON file statically, you wouldn't need to access the .default property:
import experienceData from '../../data/experienceData.json';
// experienceData contains the actual JSON data directly

But with dynamic imports, the result is always an object representing the module, hence the need to access default.

### Summary
The line .then((data) => setExperienceData(data.default)) is necessary to extract the JSON content from the dynamically imported module object and update the component state with that content. This pattern ensures that the component only attempts to access the JSON data once it's successfully loaded, allowing for efficient data handling and lazy loading.
